# SolVeil

## Overview

SolVeil (Solar Veil) is a decentralized password manager that combines self-custody security with blockchain-based data persistence. Users maintain complete control over their encrypted data while optionally leveraging Solana blockchain storage for enhanced reliability and cross-device synchronization.

This repository contains the **smart contracts** that power SolVeil's on-chain functionality.

[Frontend repository](https://github.com/MedvedCrypto/SolVeil-UI)

## Key Features

- **Crypto Wallet Integration**: Uses browser wallet signatures for encryption key derivation
- **Dual Storage Model**: Free local backups with optional paid on-chain storage
- **Self-Custody Security**: No master passwords stored, wallet-based encryption
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Smart conflict resolution when merging data across devices
- **Payment Flexibility**: Accepts different tokens for account creation and storage rent
- **Account Migration**: Secure two-step process for moving accounts between wallet addresses

## How It Works

### Encryption Model
- Uses Ed25519 wallet signatures to derive encryption keys via HKDF
- AES-GCM-SIV encryption for data protection
- No direct access to private keys or seed phrases required

### Storage Architecture
1. **Local Storage** (Free): Encrypted JSON backups with automatic conflict resolution
2. **On-Chain Storage** (Paid): Encrypted data stored on Solana with rent-based pricing

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface DataRecord {
  Date: number;      // Unix timestamp of last modification
  label: string;     // User-defined service label  
  password: string;  // Encrypted password
  note: string;      // Optional notes/comments
}

interface Backup {
  nonce: number;     // Encryption nonce
  data: string;      // Base64 encoded encrypted data
}
```

### Smart Contract Features
- **Account Management**: Create, activate, and migrate user accounts
- **Storage Allocation**: Dynamic storage space management with rent calculation
- **Payment Processing**: Multi-token support (SOL, USDC, WBTC) with DEX integration
- **Data Operations**: Encrypted data storage and retrieval
- **Security**: Account rotation and access control mechanisms

## Development Workflow

1. Generate program ID and update it in files
```sh
clear && ./program_id.sh registry
```

2. Build programs
```sh
clear && ./build.sh
```

3. Test programs
```sh
clear && bun test-rs-l
```

4. Deploy programs
```sh
clear && ./deploy.sh devnet registry
```
